**Summary**  
Ego is always there, telling us we should be doing better, that we aren't as good as those around us, or that they're trash and we're top of the pile. Ryan Holiday combines case studies of ego running wild, with tales of people who managed to control their ego, such as General Marshall.

**Structure**  
The book is split up into three main sections:
- Aspire (getting there)
- Success (you've made it)
- Failure (it's all gone wrong)

It covers how ego affects us, and how to deal with it, in each of these stages of success.
