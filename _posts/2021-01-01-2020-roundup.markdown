It's fair to say that 2020 has been an interesting year for everyone. For me, I started the year finishing several months of working as an associate lecturer for Sheffield Hallam University, a short term post after finishing my PhD with the aim of saving money to go backpacking in early February. My trip to South America lasted 6 weeks, before a mad journey to get home as governments panicked to deal with the impending COVID-19 pandemic. I made it home on the 17th March, 6 days before UK lockdown.

Since then, I've been lucky enough to pick up work that I can do from home (including starting a [business](https://rosebrothersdigital.co.uk/)). However, with lockdown after lockdown, I've also had lots of time to read.

I started reading properly in January 2016, when my brother and I set ourselves the goal of reading a book a week for that year. Since then, I've managed to beat this target each year, reading a mixture of fiction and non-fiction, across a wide range of subjects (the only barrier of entry to my reading list is a rating of above 3.9 on Goodreads!) I tend to have one fiction and one non-fiction on the go, that I'll swap between depending on the heaviness of the book, the time of day, and how bad my stress headache is.

This year, however, I realised in around June that I was on pace to break the triple figures. I've managed to maintain that consistency, even through the mental struggle that has been 2020, and reached 101. An achievement that I will probably not be able to achieve again, not least without some stat padding.

So, after 101 books and 35,586 pages, I've managed to whittle down an initial list of 20 books into a top 10 that I've read this year, split into non-fiction and fiction categories (in no particular order). Here we go...

**Disclaimer**

Not everyone enjoys reading, and not everyone has the luxury of time to read like I do, so please take whatever useful information you can from this post, but try not to compare yourself with it. I'm still setting myself the book a week target for 2021 because who knows what might happen in the coming year!

For those of you thinking "how much time does it take to read all those books?!" the answer is about 2 to 2.5 hours a day (or around 100 pages).

**Stats**

I've now compiled a nice round five years using Goodreads, which means I can generate lots of interesting graphs for those who are interested...
