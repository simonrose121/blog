The earth has completed another lap of the sun, and it's time for my 2021 reading round-up. 

My goal, as always, was to read a book a week, across a wide range of subjects and a mixture of fiction and non-fiction. The year started off with another UK lockdown, and I continued [last years](2021-01-01-2020-roundup.markdown) pace by reading 27 books from January to March. However, a combination of the easing of restrictions (and the subsequent rejuvenation of my social life), becoming busier and busier with work and taking on some hefty books (I'm looking at you A Song of Ice and Fire), I finished on a total of [68 books this year](https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2021/22312452).

My reading strategy was much the same as last year, I've had a fiction and a non-fiction book on the go at any one time. I tend to only read books with over a 3.9 rating on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22312452-simon-rose), what's the point in reading bad books?

I've decided to keep the fans happy, so here are my top 10 books from 2021 split into 5 non-fiction and 5 fiction, in no particular order...

**Non-fiction**

#### Stillness Is the Key: An Ancient Strategy for Modern Life - Ryan Holiday

![Stillness Is the Key - Cover]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/stillnessisthekey.jpeg){:width="150px"}

I've read most of Ryan Holiday's philosophy books, but this is by far my favourite. Stillness Is the Key takes ancient wisdom on the art of stillness from some of history's greatest thinkers (Confucius, Seneca, etc.) and describes succinctly how we can (and should) use it to counteract overstimulation of modern life. As a man who loves silence, solitude and consideration, this really resonated with me, and Holiday's style of writing means that every second sentence is quotable.

*"'All of humanity’s problems,' Blaise Pascal said in 1654, 'stem from man’s inability to sit quietly in a room alone.'"*

*"A wealth of information creates a poverty of attention."*

*"'Nothing is enough for the man to whom enough is too little.'"*

*"It was Cicero who said that to study philosophy is to learn how to die."*

#### Think Again: The Power of Knowing What You Don't Know - Adam Grant

![Think Again - Cover]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/thinkagain.jpeg){:width="150px"}

Think Again is a book with a simple but profound message: be willing to accept when you're wrong. Grant covers the reasons why we get mired in our views and opinions and the strategies we can use to 'rethink' them. He does this on a personal and a cultural level, and explains ways to help others to 'think again' on apt topics such as vaccination. 

I particularly enjoyed this book because the unwillingness to rethink is pervasive across daily life, everything that we do and the way we do it should be open for debate, from what we have for breakfast, to our goals and motivations, to our political leanings, to the organisation of society.

When have you changed your mind this year?

*"'Progress is impossible without change; and those who cannot change their minds cannot change anything.' - George Bernard Shaw"*

*"The purpose of learning isn’t to affirm our beliefs; it’s to evolve our beliefs."*

*"Requiring proof is an enemy of progress."*

*"It’s a rare person who wants to hear what he doesn’t want to hear."*

#### With the End in Mind: Dying, Death, and Wisdom in an Age of Denial - Kathryn Mannix

![With the End in Mind - Cover]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/withtheendinmind.jpeg){:width="150px"}

Talking about and thinking about death is uncomfortable and even taboo, even though it's a shared human experience and something we all deal with throughout (and at the end of) our lives. Dr. Kathryn Mannix beautifully draws together stories on death from her job as a palliative care nurse. This book was emotional to read, but the message is one of acceptance and that understanding and meeting death gently can have a profound impact on all those affected by the end of a life, along with the importance of death as a part of life.

*"There are only two days with fewer than twenty-four hours in each lifetime, sitting like bookends astride our lives: one is celebrated every year, yet it is the other that makes us see living as precious."*

*"Instead of dying in a dear and familiar room with people we love around us, we now die in ambulances and emergency rooms and intensive care units, our loved ones separated from us by the machinery of life preservation."*

*"Reclaiming the language of illness and dying enables us to have simple, unambiguous conversations about death."*

*"It’s a truth rarely acknowledged that as we live longer thanks to modern medicine, it is our years of old age that are extended, not our years of youth and vigour."*
