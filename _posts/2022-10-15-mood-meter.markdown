It was the summer of 2020, and after a jilted backpacking trip to South America and 4 months of lockdown, my mental health was at an ebb. I was in the midst of my [101 book](2021-01-01-2020-roundup.markdown) year, and in August I read [Permission to Feel by Marc Brackett](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43782400-permission-to-feel).

The book that focuses on teaching and training emotional intelligence: being able to recognise, understand, label, express and regulate your emotions. The method that Brackett and his research team have developed divides emotions into four quadrants along two axis: low and high energy, and unpleasant and pleasant. They also developed a mobile app, called [Mood Meter](https://moodmeterapp.com/), where you can report your emotions using this matrix, and this allows you to track your mood over time.

Mood tracking is something that I've tried a few times over the years and never managed to get to stick. So I was eager to see whether I could report my moods using this process. Brackett suggests that emotions should be reported as and when they arise. However, when I read the book, I wasn't in a headspace where I wanted to explore what I was feeling. So, I tried it for a few days and found it very uncomfortable, and stopped.

#### The Breakthrough

Fast forward to late January 2021 and I had just finished [When Breath Becomes Air by Paul Kalanithi](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25899336-when-breath-becomes-air), a heart-breaking memoir written by a 36-year-old neurosurgeon who was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer and is coming to terms with his own morality. What I took from his story was the importance of awareness, understanding yourself, and not letting life pass you by. It was then that I took the tentative step to go back to reporting my moods, but instead of doing it when particularly strong emotions arise (I would never think to do it if this was the case), I would attempt to log my mood in the morning, lunchtime and evening, every day. As with diet and exercise, the best routine is one that you can stick to!

It is now late 2022, and I've logged my mood on Mood Meter 3 times every day since the 31st January 2021, 654 days at the time of writing. The rest of this post will explain how I've kept this up, what I've learnt and most importantly, how it's made me feel.

Note: I'll use the terms 'emotions', 'feelings' and 'moods' interchangably throughout this article.

### Questions and Answers

#### How do you keep it up?

As I discussed in my blog post on [meditation](2022-01-23-500-days-of-headspace.markdown), I use Todoist to keep track of what I need to do during the day. I then have the widget on my phone's home screen, so this list is visible every time I unlock it. I have had instances where the widget has broken, and I forget to do most of the things on the list... but it works for me most of the time! For anyone who struggles to remember to do menial tasks during the day, this approach has done wonders for me.

On Todoist, I have three items, one for Mood Meter Morning, Lunch and Evening, and I tick them off when I've reported my mood in the app.111

#### How do you pick a mood?

The app works by first selecting a quadrant, then choosing a mood within that quadrant. I'll firstly work out if I'm feeling high or low energy and then if the emotion is unpleasant or pleasant. This helps narrow down what my prevailing feeling is at the time. It's worth noting that it's not an exact science, and it doesn't matter if you get it wrong - it's about building awareness over time.

Side note, these same skills are often employed in meditation, recognising and letting go of both thoughts and feelings, a practice known as [noting](https://www.headspace.com/articles/noting-technique-take-advantage). 

#### What impact has it made to your life?

Along with daily meditation, tracking my mood has had a huge impact on my self-awareness and emotional intelligence. It hasn't stopped me going through difficult patches, but recognising that it will pass and that it's okay to feel that way has done wonders for me. It has also helped me reflect on my life, I wasn't in a good place when I started tracking my mood, and I was still reporting mostly pleasant feelings, which was an insight I never would've found out otherwise. It has also helped identify particularly stressful periods in my life, and caused me to think about what might be causing that. For example, August this year was a particularly stressful month.

Doing it at a set point each day (kind of, there are sometimes hours of variance as you can see in the image above) forces me to consider about how I'm feeling, and to build awareness that if what I'm feeling is unpleasant, that those feelings will soon pass and it'll be a green mood sometime soon. It's also helped me understand when I need some time out, or the sort of things that influence my mood on a day-to-day basis.

#### Would you recommend others doing it?

Self-awareness is interesting, I've always been interested in understanding more about myself, but I know that not everyone is comfortable doing that. I do think that understanding your mood, however you do it, is an important part of being able to regulate your own emotions.

The book itself is well worth a read if you're interested in more of the science behind the model. Brackett also covers how to introduce these skills into the classroom and workplace, which is a fascinating idea.

#### Will you carry on?

Yes! For as long as I can, or as long as the app is still supported...
